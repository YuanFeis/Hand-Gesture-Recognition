# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

Automatic detection and classification of dynamic hand gestures in real-world environments and its application in human-computer interfaces is a challenging task that has gained significant scientific interest in recent years. 

This project aims to implement a system that performs simultaneous detection and classification of dynamic hand gestures from multimodal data and further, uses the detected gestures to control desktop applications. The dataset used is the [Jester](https://20bn.com/datasets/jester) dataset which contains 148K short clips of videos that depict a person performing a gesture in front of a camera.
